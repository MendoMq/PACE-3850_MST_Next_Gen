                        <p classname="committeeText">Jonathon (Jono) Coleman became SMST’s founding patron in 2016, and vigorously promoted the theatre’s urgent reopening. Jono was a well-known radio and television host both in Australia and England for over forty years. He was renowned for his irrepressible sense of fun and the generosity to many causes which gained him an OAM.
                                                    Most memorably, Jono compèred Marian Street Theatre’s fiftieth birthday party in late 2016, organising the luscious birthday cake himself.
                                                    ‘As a long-time Lindfield resident,’ he told the crowd, ‘I spent many evenings at Marian Street Theatre. I even interviewed Ruth Cracknell there on stage for Simon Townsend’s Wonder World in the 1980s, and was so upset when it closed. Let’s get it opened pronto before we miss more opening nights.’
                                                    Sadly, Jono won’t be here to celebrate the theatre’s re-opening with us. He died in July 2021, far too young, and always wide-eyed as the child within him. We will remember you, Jono. Your effervescent enthusiasm for our theatre always raised our spirits high. Vale, and thank you.</p>
